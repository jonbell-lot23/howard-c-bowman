# Howard Bowman: His Life

This is an biography of my life based on my memories after reaching early adulthood. Since I am the sole survivor in most cases, there is room for controversy. Much of this is based on my memory, which is imperfect at best, however, I will make every effort to be both truthful and factual in all cases.

My earliest memories are some vague snippets of memory which must date to the middle 1920s. i have a vague memory of being in a car with several of my older sisters, we were driving on a country road and my sisters were arguing violently about the breed of bird which had just passed. One party in the argument vowed that the bird in question was a cardinal while the other camp insisted that the bird was a redbird. In the course of the argument the driver lost control of the car and we ran into a ditch.

A second snippet of memory dealt with some photographs taken of my sister and l. We were dressed very nicely and a professional photographer was taking the pictures. Probably before 1924.

A third snippet of memory was of me and my mother on a railroad train in the coach. The interior of the coach was panelled with light coloured wood. I would imagine the event was on our journey to live in Pensacola Florida in the middle 1920s. My father was employed there in the late 1920's after suffering bankruptcy in Louisiana. Vile lived there from approximately 1924 until 1930. My father built several commercial structures including a dairy in the shape of a milk bottle.

My eldest sister, Henrietta.. and her husband came to live with us during that period I am not sure about the circumstances but they lived with us. Her husband, Jesse Hay, may have been employed by my dad, I am not sure- However he was also e carpenter and loved children.Although they were childless at that time in their life, he spent a great deal of time with us and was a good influence! Many of the games we learned to play as children he taught us.

My brother, Horace, and I went to the Saturday afternoon matinee every chance we got. Admission price was only a nickel and we saw a western and a comedy. Horace and I would come home and re-enact the thrilling scenes in the movie. One time in the act of re-enacting a fight over a knife in the movie I stabbed him in the chest. He wore the scar the rest of his life.

It was during this period that experienced my first hurricane. It was later classed as the Miami hurricane of 1926. it first made landfall in the Miami area and after traversing the Miami strait, ft changed direction and made final landfall at Pensacola. It was probably a C!ass 4 hurricane. remember hearing the fierce winds and watching huge oak trees fall to the ground. Fortunately, to the best of my memory we suffered no damage.

It was during this time in Pensacola that I enrolled in grammar School. It was in September 1928 and t was six years old. What an experience!

Sometime after the experience with the hurricane we, as a family, made one or more trips back to Louisiana for a visit. Since there was little or no travel by automobile in those days, there was little or no accommodations for automobile travellers. We simply camped out beside the road. Mother cooked meals on an open fire and we slept either 'n the car or on I-ha ground. A trip from Pensacola to Central Louisiana usually took three or four days. There was little or no improved highways and in many cases no bridges over minor water ways. Travel was an adventure and we kids thoroughly enjoyed the trips.

Two of my teen aged sisters were employed as usherettes at the ISIS theatre in Pensacola. They both met their future husbands there. One sister, Mildred, married a Chief Petty Officer, Hugh Duggan, who had two orphan daughters, Lillian and Yvonne. The other daughter, Vera, married Maurice East, a Second Class Storekeeper who was the scion of a wealthy Chicago family.

I never knew, but Hugh was a Chief Boatswains Mate on a Naval Air Station and was probably Chief Master at Arms for the base. I know that he had quarters on base and was able to get material that would not be generally available. He brought my mother several air towed gunnery target sleeves which had apparently been used and surveyed. Although they had several bullet holes in them, they were of excellent material and Mother could fashion very good clothing from them.

While we were living in Florida, an elderly man came to live with us. He was identified as our t "grandfather". I never knew who he was. I was too young to begin to evaluate family relationships but later analysis indicates that he was our paternal Grandfather. never knew and never asked. He was unpleasant old coot and kept Mother upset a great deal of the time as his sanitary habits were not of the best. We boys were not good to him. He habitually sat on the front porch facing east. My brother and I spent a great deal of time arranging mirrors so that a given time they would reflect the morning sunlight in the old man's eyes. I don't know what happened to him. I have no idea if and when he left.

Maurice East, known to the family as "East" and his little family were transferred to the Panama Canal Zone. While living there the couple had a second daughter, Norma.
As sources of employment began to fade in Florida, my father and family moved back to Louisiana, which was Mother's home state. The family rented a forlorn little house adjacent to the L&A railroad tracks in Pineville. There was no electricity, no heat but it did have water. We used oil tamps and burned wood to keep warm.

Vera and East returned from Panama and brought a huge German Shepherd dog with them. It was poorly trained and pretty much a pest. One day it got out of the yard and went on a killing spree.. Dad gave it to a relative who owned a farm and It killed several sheep and one calf before it was destroyed. was scared to death about that dog!

My father was unable to find employment and for several months we had hard times. Fortunately his credit was good due to his former ability as a building developer. For several months we existed on the food and necessary household necessities
which he was able to get on credit.

When Huey Long was elected Governor of the state of Louisiana one of his primary efforts was to establish a highway department charged with the task of up-grading the highways in the state. The department established criteria which set forth that primary roads were to be poured concrete and secondary roads were to be good gravel. This gave a great boost to the lagging construction industry throughout the state.
In early 1930 my father became employed by the
State of Louisiana as a Bridge Construction Superintendent, charged with the construction of standard design bridges over secondary waterways. He assembled the portable system he would require to accomplish this task. For a primary power source he selected a large diese! tractor with a power take off attachment. With this machine he could skid the piling and major timbers into position. He could assemble a pile driver out of standing pine trees, which he would cut on site, and use the power takeoff to raise and lower the pile driver hammer. So his complete bridge construction system could be carried in a single 16 wheel flatbed truck.

His first assignment was to construct a series of bridges in a raised roadway across Catahoula Lake in Central Louisiana. The roadway was several miles long and required several sing!e span bridges . He was involved for several weeks before the roadway could he opened to traffic M}' brother and I camped on a newly constructed bridge for a week. We had a ball! No one but us fishing and the fish biting. At the end of the week we carried home a wash tub full of small perch. Of course we ate all our supplies by the end of the third day and ate fish or starved the last two.

With his increased income we were able to move to a better house. The house we moved into had a small creek on the property. It was filled with small perch and crawfish My brother and I spent a great deal of the summer playing in this creek. Unfortunately, the water the water was badly polluted and as a result I contacted spinal meningitis. Since this was in the day before sulfa drugs and other modern treatments were available, was deathly sick for a considerable time.

My mother injured herself trying to care for me at home and never completely recovered. My sister , Viola, who was a senior in high school, helped her mother in caring for me. The attending doctor was impressed with my sister and sponsored her education her education at Baylor University School of Nursing. She became a Registered Nurse and remained in Texas.

When recovered, my neighbour, Joe Smith. invited me to attend Sunday School with his family. I began attending regularly with him. When Communion was offered, Joe partook but would not let me. I asked why and he told me that only members of the church were allowed to participate. He also told me that I would have to make a "Profession of Faith" and be baptised in order to become a member.

The next Sunday at the end of the service when an invitation was given I went forward. was then baptised and accepted into the membership of First Baptist Church of Pineville, Louisiana.

In view of the danger surrounding the proximity of the polluted creek, we moved again to a house that was further away. The house we moved to was provided with water, sewer, and electricity. Heat and cooking was accomplished by wood stoves and fire places. Dad hauled piling scrap from the job which we split for firewood. My
brother and I got an education in the use of a crosscut saw and a splitting wedge in preparing wood for the several fires.

The following Christmas my parents gave my brother and me small single shot 22 rifles as a Christmas present. We delighted in those guns and spent every dime we came across for practice ammunition. An obliging grocer would break open a box of shells and sell them to us by the piece. We haunted the little patch of pine woods within walking distance.

One day, after a day of shooting, I crumbled the bag which held the shells and threw it in the fireplace. One shell remained in the bag and ignited sending the projectile within a fraction of an inch from my Mother's unprotected neck. You can be sure that ever after any package associated with ammunition was not burned.
When Dad completed the series of bridges on Catahoula Lake, he was assigned to the Winnfieid area to build a several span bridge. We of course, moved to Winnfield. We rented a house with a lot big enough to permit a vegetable garden and a small cow lot. This would allow Mother to have a cow and a garden. She had not recovered from the stress she had undergone in nursing me through my long illness. Her doctor advised her to get a cow and to drink plenty of rich mi!k to build up her system.

My brother and I erected the necessary fence to divide the back yard into a cow lot and a garden. We then spaded the garden area . We then cleared the garden area of grass and weeds and using a small garden plow, (with one pulling and one pushing) to set up several rows suitable for planting. A portion of the spaded and cleared soil was left out of the row configuration to allow "broadcast" seeding of certain, vegetables.

For our effort we were allowed to plant a portion of the garden in popcorn and peanuts. When the peanuts were harvested the plants were saved as roughage for the cow
In Winnfield, I had my first encounter with the concept of "merchandising". I inherited a group of people to whom I delivered a copy of the weekly, Coltiers Magazine, for which I collected five cents each. I also sold them on the street. I then paid Curtis Publishing Company three cents each for the magazines sold. Since Colliers was a weekly magazine I made a few dollars a month on this project.

Also, in Winnfield that became convinced of relationship with the Lord. I again went forward on an invitation, discussed my spiritual state with the pastor and again submitted to baptism. I think this time it was for real.

When Dad completed the bridge in Winnfield, he was assigned a new effort back near Pineville. Since this involved a family move back to the Pineville area, he and Mother decided to buy a place in Central Louisiana as a permanent home and for him to travel to the several jobs on a temporary basis, returning home on the weekend.

He and Mother looked at several potential home sites and finally settled on the house which would be our home from then on at 66 Bertie Street. This house had three bedrooms and a capability to expand to four or more. The house was structurally sound and for sale at a very reasonable price. The tot was fifty by one hundred fifty feet and the adjacent lots on either side were vacant and for sale at an equally reasonable price. He purchased the house and the adjacent lots giving him a one hundred fifty by one hundred fifty foot plot.

He then had my brother and J set fences as far back from the street a.s the front of the house giving him an uncluttered one hundred fifty by thirty front lawn
He then removed the wooden front porch and replaced it with a twelve by thirty poured concrete porch with concrete steps to the walk leading to the street and a step leading to a covered car port. He then installed a double swing hung from the ceiling. This became his favorite relaxing place when he was at home.

We then fenced the next forty feet by fifty feet on the two vacant adjacent properties, giving him two fifty by forty fenced areas. One was designated the garden plot and the other the cow lot. On the remaining fifty feet we built barns using salvaged galvanized roofing. These barns were used to store lumber, cow feed, and included a milking stall as well as provide a chicken house.

The back of the property we fenced with solid, unfinished 1 h x 12 inch boards.
We then used brushes to paint the foundation structure of the house with creosote to ward off termites. This was a terrible task since the creosote would blister the skin if it was not protected. We used butter as a skin coating to protect ourselves.

The existing garage was converted into a cabinet shop with all tools necessary to convert rough sawn lumber into a finished piece of cabinetry. About this time Hugh and Mildred moved to Alexandria along with the three daughters. They joined with Jesse and Henrietta and moved in to a duplex not far away. Hugh had gotten a job in a Managerial position with the Civilian Conservation Corps at Camp Beauregard. After they lived there several months, Mildred came to see her Mother all upset.

Apparently, Jesse had walked in on Hugh and Lillian in a compromising situation And as a result, Hugh and Mildred moved. After several days there was a reconciliation and Mildred and Hugh with Jackie and Yvonne bought the house next door. Apparently Lillian was out of the picture. I understand she was sent to a convent in South Louisiana. And It seems Mildred had reconciled with her differences with Hugh. I don’t know if ever there was communication between Henriette and Mildred.

About this time Henrietta and Jesse bought a lot across the street and erected a small two bedroom house which became their permanent residence. Jesse continued to work for the local ice company delivering ice to the several residences in a given area. Since residential mechanical refrigerators were rare, ice was widely used to preserve food-
Henrietta got a job in the local laundry.

When he retired from the Navy, East and Vera bought a house in the next block. She also got a job in the laundry while East was employed by the Defense Department.
Along about this time, Vera's daughter, Eloise, became ill with spinal meningitis. Fortunately, the first of the wonder drugs were available so she had a rapid cure.
Mother used the garden plot to grow vegetables for the table and preserved the excess, So most of the year the vegetables we ate were produced in the garden plot. She rotated the planting so that the garden produced crops year around. In addition to the output of the garden, we gathered fruits from various sources which she preserved for the table.

In the proper season we gathered Blackberries which thrived on most of the vacant property. There were two versions of what we called "blackberries". One fruited early and was large and succulent.. we termed "dewberries'\* and were much sought after because of their size and taste. These were followed by a smatter berry which we called blackberries. Mother used both varieties to make and preserve Jelly, preserves, and wine.

A rather large fig orchard was planted not too far from our house. The figs were of the Purple Celeste Variety which were sweet and valuable as preserves. When the crop was ripe the owner allowed harvesting on a shared basis. Each quantity harvested was shared on an even basis. One quantity for the owner and one portion for the harvester. We gathered several gallons each crop year and Mother preserved them.

Another crop which was gathered from public lands was the May Haw. This was a small berry type fruit which flourished in and around the of high water and often were gathered off the surface of the water with minnow seines. Mother made very delicious jelly from this fruit, Mother preserved fruits of various sorts. She had a five gallon crock which she used to ferment blackberries and make a very good wine which she bottled and stored for aging for several years. She often had wines which had aged more than ten years.

She experimented with unusual fruits in her wine making hobby. On some occasions she made peach brandy from the peelings left from preserving peaches. She also made a very good white wine by fermenting the blossoms of the elder berry. One year my sister, Mildred, and Mother purchased a canning outfit from Montgomery Ward and toured the farms of relatives in the vicinity. They proposed providing the cans and necessary canning equipment to preserve whatever vegetable the grower wished to preserve.

That summer as a result of that effort we were able to store literally dozens of cans of canned vegetables. Dad built a long cabinet in the hallway of our home to accommodate the cans. The cabinet was in the form of a closet but only deep enough to accommodate a single Number 2 can. My brother was having difficulty in high school and dropped out of high school as a sophomore and enlisted in the U.S. Navy on a minority enlistment. He was seventeen at the time. He ultimately became a parachute rigger. This is the person in a squadron who who cares for the parachutes of the flight personnel. He was assigned to Patrol Squadron 44 in Dutch Harbor, Alaska.

Early in my life, about twelve years old, I purchased a bicycle from Montgomery Ward with Dad's help. He simply co-signed the sales contract while it was necessary for me to earn the money to make the necessary monthly payments. Since it was summer and I was out of school, I searched for some sort of a job and was hired by a local grocery store to deliver groceries in response to telephone orders . was also required to act as a sales clerk in the store and to do the necessary cleaning. My pay was $2.50 per week. Since my payment to Montgomery Ward was $5.00 a month ! was able to save enough to buy my school clothes for the year.

When school started in the fall, I was unable to keep my job.

But fortunately t was able to find a similar job with a local drug store, however the hours were from 4:30 PM until 9:00 PM at a slightly higher salary.

This was the first time that I had been associated with a person whose task was related to his scientific training. I soon realized that I too would like to obtain an advanced education which would be useful in my future career. I then set my sights on becoming a pharmacist. I selected the remaining courses in High School to point in that direction.
When I graduated from High School, i hoped to continue my education at LSI-J. Hoping to get a degree in Pharmacy. My father refused to support any further education even though tuition was only $20,00 per semester.

I was then forced to get some sort of employment. I found a job with one of the major furniture companies. It was to deliver console radios put up antennas and make sure the radio was functioning property. That job only lasted a short time and I was dismissed. Apparently the sales of console radios was not sufficient to pay the expense of the delivery and my salary.

I was then able to get a job with a focal taxicab company. My duties involve answering the telephone and directing the nearest taxi to pick up the customer. My employer had procured several very high frequency radios which he had installed in the taxis. Since their operating frequency was outside the range monitored by the Federal Communications Commission, there was no problem with the authorities in using them. This was my first contact with amateur radio.

This was the period in which the President declared a National Emergency and began to draft and train troops. The area around my home town became a hotbed of troops undergoing training. There were three major training camps in the im:nediate vicinity. The population of the parish went from a few thousands to literally millions. Of course the public transport business, Including the taxicab business, had alt the business that they could handle. I was promoted from telephone operator to a taxicab driver in short order because I had a driver's license and knew the town.

As the National circumstances continued to escalate, and as my age became closer to the draft age, I went to my Brother in Law, the former Navy Storekeeper, now employed by the Army Material Command, and asked his advice. His advice, and ! quote "If a dry bed and a hot meal is important, choose the Navy!”

So I began effort to enlist in the Navy. I was slightly underweight and had to take corrective measures to weigh enough to be accepted. But passed the physical and was enlisted in the Regular Navy for a period of six years.

After awaiting several days for a group of several recruits to be assembled, we were transported by train to the Naval Training Station in San Diego, California for Recruit Training. We arrived at the Training Station late on Friday evening and were
immediately placed in isolation to assure that no one in the group was carrying a communicable disease. We remained in isolation for a period of four weeks. During his period we were isolated from other inhabitants qf the Training Station and kept from any contact with other residents, We were not allowed to go on "liberty" for another month.

The first breakfast after our arrival was a classical Boston Saturday Breakfast consisting of Baked Beans and scrapple, which was unheard fare for a little Louisiana boy. Monday after our arrival we were issued a seabag, hammock, and a standard issue of both summer and winter uniforms. We spent the rest of the day under instruction on the care and storing our uniforms. Each piece of clothing was stenciled with our name , rolled neatly, tied precisely with small lengths of cord called "clothes stops". They were rolled inside out so that any soil would be on the inside when folded out for dressing, All uniforms were stored in a canvas "seabag" which would hold a person's entire winter and summer uniform if folded and rolled properly and stored orderly. The hammock was issued but never used.

We were assigned quarters in "companies" of 130 men. We were assigned to two CPO instructors. These were seasoned Navy CPO's from the "deck Ratings" ie Boatswains Mates, Gunners Mates", etc. These men were assigned to provide the necessary instruction and discipline to make seamen out of us. The equivalent of Drill Sergeants . Instructions received during the boot camp are such that the young man is capable to serve as a member of the Navy.

During the process the young recruit is carefully evaluated physically as well as mentally. From his mental evaluation his capability for further Naval service is determined . went into this evaluation process convinced that my ultimate goal in life would be as a pharmacist. However the General Classification Test indicated that I was best suited for clerical activities. As a result I was given the opportunity to volunteer for instruction as a Radioman (Qual-Air). This training would enable me to serve as a radio operator aboard ships and shore stations as well as a flight operator. I did volunteer and as a result at the end of my recruit training, I was transferred to the Radioman’s School (Qual-Air) at the Naval Air Station North Island.

The purpose of this school was to train me to be an aviation radio operator. This training involved learning to send and receive Morse Code at the rate of better than twelve words a minute. Also to get a brief understanding of radio theory as related to the radio equipment of the period. In addition I became proficient in the use of a .30 caliber machine gun in air to air combat.

I was promoted from Apprentice Seaman automatically to Seaman 2c with an increase in pay From $21.00 per month to $36.00 per month after three months service.
The school was for a period of three months, however the Christmas Holidays came about after I was in school about a month. The school declared a two week holiday for Christmas. I wanted to go home for Christmas but only had $30.00 which was a long way from the cost of a bus or train ticket. There were several from East Texas and Louisiana in much the same situation. I had an idea l we pooled our money perhaps we could buy a suitable used car on time payments and default on the payments and have the car repossessed after we returned. A group of six East Texas and Louisiana boys decided to give it a try.

We pooled our available funds and wound up with $175.00. We then shopped the used car dealers on Auto Row and uncovered a nice little 4-door 1934 Ford which had recently had an engine overhaul and new paint job for $250.00. The dealer agreed to sell us the car for $50.00 down and $25.00 per month payments. We bought the car leaving us $125.00 for gas on the way to Louisiana. We set out in the car. There were six of us in a five passenger sedan. So naturally we were crowded. We tied our baggage on the fenders and away we went.

We had not gotten to Yuma, Arizona before the engine began to run rough. None of us had enough experience to try to ascertain the problem. We simply made sure that the plug wires were tight and the engine had plenty of oil.

By driving steadily with several drivers we reached East Texas in about 36 hours and my home in forty Of course my parents were delighted to see me.

While in Alexandria I took the car to a service station recommended by Jesse Hay. The service station attendant could not identify the reason for the rough engine so we simply got back in the car and returned to San Diego. It was touch and go for the last one hundred and fifty miles. Upon our return we simply parked the car in the parking lot until we had liberty to return the car to the dealer. While we were waiting one of the mechanic types in the barracks inspected the engine and informed me that the cylinder head was so loose that it rattled when the engine was cold.

This indicated that the person who had done the engine overhaul had neglected to run the overhauled engine and torqued the heads after a run-in. So we warmed the engine and performed the torquing operation in the parking lot.

I decided to keep the car since the sales contract was in my name and continued to make the necessary payments. Shortly before I completed the school, a classmate invited me to take him to his home in Eastern California for the weekend. I agreed and as we approached his home town the car burned out a connecting rod. took it to a garage in his home town and the mechanic there agreed to replace the rod for $25,00. So we left the car in his garage and returned to San Diego, Before I could return and retrieve the car, I was transferred to NAS Pensacola. Although the car was still in California, felt responsible for the balance due. l, therefore continued to make the payments until the balance due was $25.00, I then wrote the finance company, enclosing the $25,00 and informed them of the location of the car and the charge against the car, gave them the choice to retrieve the car by paying the mechanic's lien or consider the contract paid up and the mechanic to seize the car on a mechanic's lien.

I never knew what happened to that car. When I completed the Radioman's school in San Diego, I requested and received a transfer to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Upon arriving at Pensacola, I was assigned to Training Squadron 2.

Three Naval Air Stations; Pensacola, Corpus Christi, and Jacksonville were engaged in training pilots. At Pensacola there were five levels of training provided. Level 1 was Primary Training In which the prospective Naval Aviator simply learned to control an aircraft in the air and to be able to take off and land safely. The aircraft used were the familiar "yellow perils". Small two place wood and fabric biplanes- Normally made by the Naval Aircraft Factory or by Stearman Aircraft. They were Fixed wing fixed landing gear aircraft.

Level 2 training was instruction in Formation Flying. When I first joined Squadron 2, the squadron was flying hand-me-down aircraft which dated back to the middle and late 1920s. They were wood and fiber observation airplanes which saw active duty in the Central America Campaign in the 1920's. The design was unique in that the gasoline tanks made up the fuselage adjacent to the entire pilot and gunner area.. The aircraft as received used inertia starters and had a very limited electrical system, primarily running lights. There was no radio equipment.

The typical instruction cycle involved three student pilots flying solo with the instructor flying a fourth chase plane. As the students performed a series of prearranged maneuvers, the instructor observed and commented on the performance after the flight.
it was decided that if the aircraft were equipped with short range radio capability, the instructor would be much more able to instruct his students if he could communicate with them in real time. It was therefore decided to equip the squadron's aircraft with radio equipment. I was selected to begin the installation process. Surplus equipment was available to install.

I began installing equipment in the aircraft under the direction of the department leading Electronics CPO. There were no plans to go by but under his direction we established a safe and effective installation. Soon most of the aircraft in the squadron were radio equipped.

By this time had advanced in rank to Radioman2C. I was making enough money to begin to try to have a life other than work. So I began to hang out in the gin mills on lower Zaragosa Street in Pensacola. The female company in those places were supposedly waitresses but they were good to relieve you of your money. It soon became apparent that if one had a chance with those gals one had to know how to dance. I didn't, so I went to the Arthur Murray Studio and took lessons. I became a fair dancer with fox trot and waltz. I then got some practice there but it cost me.

As activities continued to escalate in the training process, we were training not only American students but British and French students. In order to accommodate the increased student load we were moved from the main station to a new outlaying field called Bronson Field. In addition, the squadron aircraft were updated from the mid 1920 biplanes to the Vultee Valiant and the Vought Kingfisher.
The Vultee Valiant was a single engine two seater aircraft powered by a Wright 450 HP engine. The Navy designation was the SNV-I. It was equipped with a complete operable electrical and radio system.

The Vought OS2U Kingfisher was originally designed as a float plane to be launched via catapult from battleships or cruisers. It was originally configured with a single large float which enabled it to land at sea for retrieval by the host battleship or cruiser. They were used in Level 5 training for cruiser pilots. As delivered to Squadron 2, the float was removed and fixed landing gear was substituted. So it was converted from a sea plane to a land plane for use as an advanced trainer.

Since the airplanes and their equipment was new, the radio maintenance was minimal. The primary task was to ensure that each four plane flight could communicate with each other. The duties in the radio division rapidly degenerated to maintaining the battery and electrical systems on the new airplanes.

When we moved to Bronson Field we became acquainted with a group of girls. They were all in their early 20's and really out for a good time. Part of them were the wives of Gl's who were not in the area. We got together as a group and really had a ball in the adjoining towns.

At that time there was no Navy rating called Aviation Electrician. Therefore, the duties which eventually became the duties of the Aviation Electrician were performed by members of the Radio Division. This included a battery shop with necessary charging equipment.

I was stationed at Bronson Field when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred. In fact, my first indication happened at the local hotel. We were given a notice that Pearl Harbor had been attacked. We were ordered to report immediately to our duty station. I returned to Bronson Field and the squadron was in chaos. They were trying to arm our Kingfishers with 30 caliber machine guns install bomb racks for depth charges etc.

It was of interest to note that in at least one occasion the fixed 30 caliber machine gun which fired through the propeller was synchronized to fire when the propeller was in front of the gun rather than when it was not. Fortunately it was discovered before the airplane shot off his own propeller.

When the excitement was over, we returned to our assigned duties, that of training Naval Aviators. One or two exciting events occurred in the coming months. The Billy Mitchell bombers paid us a visit. They were practicing short field takeoffs- We had no idea who they were but later news allowed us to identify them.

In mid-1942, a bulletin was published from NAS Norfolk asking for volunteer radiomen for the Naval Air Transport Service- No one knew what the Naval Air Transport Service was, but since I had been in Pensacola for over two years, I volunteered. Shortly another radioman and I were transferred to Air Transport Squadron One at the Naval Air Station, Norfolk.

When we arrived we were the fifty first and fifty second enlisted members of the squadron and the first two regular Navy members. The previous members were Naval Reserve members who had worked in the airlines and had been called to active duty. There were former employees from American Airlines, Eastern Airlines, United Airlines, etc.

As I later came to realize most of the Officers were former airline captains again recalled to active duty, They were for the most part former Navy Cadets. It was then that I became aware that the Navy in their pilot training activities in the 1930's trained pilots as aviation cadets, sent them to the fleet as cadets for a period then commissioned them and transferred them to the Naval Reserve.

They were snapped up by the several airlines since most of them had experience in multi-engine aircraft. When they returned to active duty they were Lieutenants.
The one exception was Lieutenant Commander Patrick J. Byrne. Pat was a regular Navy former Warrant Officer World War One pilot. His duty in the squadron was to teach the young pilots how to handle the squadron flying boats on the water.

It seems that the present inventory of aircraft in the squadron consisted of two R4D's, the familiar airline DC-3 and six former Pan-AM Clippers, purchased from PAN-AM.
Two of these were mid 1930's amphibians that had seen their best service, The remaining four were Sikorsky S_42 flying boats that had recent service in the Caribbean. In addition, the squadron had one PBM-3 Martin Mariner bomber which had been converted to a transport.

The squadron had established flight schedules using R4Ds from Washington to Charleston to Jacksonville to Corpus Christi on a bi-weekly basis. They had also established a schedule from Washington to Boston. With squadron's Martin Mariner PBM., LCDR Byrne began a series of survey flights to establish North Atlantic routes for aircraft using the Northern route. Prior to World War Two, transatlantic flights followed the path used by Pan American Airways with the Clippers. Via Miami, Recife, Ascension island, Azores and Europe.

The Seaplane Division of VR-I was re-named VR-6 and transferred to the Pan Am Base at Miami, Florida. The Navy constructed a series of Quonset huts to use as office space and rented half a hanger from Pan American for aircraft maintenance.

VR 6 then established routes from Miami to Guantanamo Bay, and San Juan using the S-42's also a weekly route from Miami to Kingston, Jamaica to Coco Solo, Panama using the PBM. Finally a scheduled flight was made from Miami to Antjlla Bay, Cuba using the PBM- This flight was to pick up nickel ore for use at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. There was also a non-scheduled flight to the Naval Air Facility on Eleuthera.

One of the most dramatic exhibitions of water work using a sea plane occurred at Eleuthera. Ona flight with LCDR Byrne as Plane Commander, we landed the PBM at Eleuthera. The prevailing wind was so strong that the engines on the PBM were simply not powerful enough to turn the airplane downwind to taxi to the required buoy for mooring. The pilot could get the airplane to turn crosswind but not downwind so that we could taxi to the buoy. LCDR Byrne then let the plane assume its heading into the wind, dropped the landing flaps and sailed the airplane BACKWARD to the buoy using the engines to steer the airplane.

In mid-1943 1 was invited to join the Mars Crew at the Martin Factory in Baltimore, Maryland as an observer, related to the completion of the modification of the Mars from a Long Range Bomber to a Transport Aircraft. The modification process had been several years in progress and upon completion would require a complete testing ot the modified aircraft. The airplane was an experimental model and would require both company testing as well as Navy testing.

The Martin Company did not have the necessary company test flight crew and we were asked to fly the airplane and conduct the tests required by the Martin Company. Upon satisfactory completion of the company tests we would then perform any additional tests required by the Navy to accept the plane. Martin Company extended every courtesy to the flight crew as we operated the airplane in accordance with their plans. SinceThe airplane was so large, test jigs were not available to statically test the physical strength of the design, it was necessary to flight test the physical strength of the airplane.

Shortly after I arrived in Baltimore I met Milly, the love of my life! I immediately tried to date her and she refused to go out with me. I persisted and she finally told me that I drank too much. After weeks of trying, I finally promised her that if she would go out with me I would drink only Coca-Cola. She relented and we had a wonderful courtship. Milly liked to go home to Gassaway as often as she could. After we had been dating for several weeks I went home with her for the weekend . (She always avowed that I invited myself!) The trip was a long one in those days. We would catch a train in Baltimore , and ride to Clarksburg, leaving Baltimore about 5PM arriving in Clarksburg about 11 PM. We would then have to wait until about 6 AM to catch the local bus that ran from Clarksburg via every small town on WY4 eventually to Charleston. We rode the bus to Gassaway, arriving about 11AM.

It was war-time and all service men were required to wear uniforms. Apparently Milly had informed her parents that I was coming home with her. When we arrived Jean met us and her comment was, "So you are Bowman! I have heard enough about you!" I was ready to stay on the bus and go on to Charleston.

But I got off and met her parents, fell in love with Tressie and soon got a great deal of respect for Simon. Bud was working as a fireman on the B&O Railroad. I met him briefly and we hit it off right away I I commented on her mince meat pie and for ever after when I was expected she had me one.

They had a dance at the Community Center and both Milly and I went. There was a shortage of guys who knew how to jitter-bug and Milly and I had a ball. When we returned to Baltimore, I became involved in the completion of the Martin Company tests. The airplane performed beautifully and we were soon involved in the Navy acceptance tests.. These tests went off well and we accepted the airplane for the US Navy . In this period of World War II there was a dearth of favorable press news from the battle front and the newspapers therefore concentrated on the advent of the Mars for a lot of favorable press. We performed a lot of widespread publicity flights and were in the press a great deal. First we conducted a Closed Course Endurance test. The airplane, with a full load of fuel maintained an even altitude as it flew in a closed pattern defined by Boston, New York and Baltimore. It flew for 27 hours and 25 minutes which was anew world's record!

The airplane then made a non-stop flight from Patuxent River, Maryland to Natal, Brazil a distance ot 4080 miles. Which at the time was a world record in distance. Upon return from the Brazil trip, the Mars Detachment in Patuxent River was transferred to VR-2 in Alameda. The airplane began systematic round trips to Honolulu. The airplane averaged two trips a week. In view of the distance and the lack of navigation aids the flights were conducted at night to take advantage of celestial navigation for positioning. A typical flight left Alameda in the early evening, 7PM Or so. The flight duration was on the order of twelve hours which meant that the arrival time in Honolulu was about 7AM. The
return flight was thirty six hours later, giving the elapsed time for a round trip of forty eight hours. So the aircraft was able to make About two trips per week , neglecting time lost for routine maintenance. The cabin load which the airplane could transport was approximately twice that of any other airplane on the schedule.

During the test year I took leave and Milly and i got married in a Maryland Justice of the Peace ceremony. Since we both knew that my stay in California was only temporary Milly, remained in Baltimore. She and two dear friends had a small apartment close to the Martin Factory.

On one of my visits Milly became pregnant with Cookie. Her friends helped her through the pregnancy. I was in and out because of my job. When the year field trial on the experimental Mars was complete, the Mars Detachment returned to Patuxent River to await the delivery of the production Mars, the JRM series. Since our stay was temporary, Milly remained in her apartment until Cookie was born. Her friends Norma and Louise stood by her since I was in and out.

I spent every available hour with her during that period, however I was stationed fifty miles away. It was a stressful time in both our lives. Cookie's arrival coincided with the delivery of aircraft which had to be flown to VR-2 in Alameda. Because of the uncertainty associated with my job, Milly decided to go home and stay with her parents until our domestic situation became more stable.

While in the San Francisco area, I made every effort to secure suitable housing so that we could begin our lives together as a family- Unfortunately there was simply no suitable living quarters . So Milly continued To stay with her parents in Gassaway. When the fourth airplane was delivered, the Mars detachment was again transferred to VR-2 in Alameda for duty.

This time, since this was a Permanent Change of station for me, i was able to request Navy housing. There was a long waiting list and in the interim I was able to rent a Federal Housing apartment in Richmond. This was a far cry from what I wanted but enabled us to become a family.

With some sort of quarters secured, I was then able to move Milly and Cookie from Gassaway to California. We used Navy transportation for the move and it was by transcontinental rail. We caught the transcontinental train in Chicago. We had Pullman seats. When we boarded the train in Chicago Milly stopped off at the first door to change Cookie's dirty diaper. While she was finishing the person who had reserved that compartment opened the door and she was almost through. She kicked the door shut in his face and when she was through simply marched past him to her place in the Pullman. I told her, "Milly that was a compartment" she said, Well, she thought it was the Ladies Room.

The major league baseball player, Ty Cobb, was on the train and he fell in love with our baby and carried her all over the train showing her off. The apartment in Richmond was about forty miles from the Naval Air Station so it was a two hour commute for me to work. Since we had no car we were not able to take advantage of the Navy Commissary. I began going to the commissary for canned stuff and non perishables and carried them on the bus to Richmond. After several months I was able to get Navy housing adjacent to the Air Station so we moved again from Richmond to Alameda.

It was a nice little two bedroom cottage within walking distance of the Naval Air Station. Milly was shy about using the commissary so she walked about six blocks to shop at a Safeway Store. She put Cookie in her stroller and walked to the store. Once, while they were shopping, Cookie pulled a glass gallon of Clorox off the shelf. Of course it shattered and Clorox went everywhere. Some splattered on the suit of a man standing nearby. The store clerk rushed around helping Milly avoid the damage but the man said "What about my suit?”

When Milly was all fixed up she left the store but she said to the irate man “Tough ain't it?” She was a case!!! We lived in this little house for almost two years. Milly used the re-enlistment bonus to completely furnish the little house properly. Because this was the era before throw away diapers Milly was spending a lot of time at the public washers getting diapers clean. We found a used Speed Queen washer in the classified ads and bought it. In almost no time when I came for lunch the kitchen was crowded with neighbors waiting to use the washer. This was a lesson for Milly and she soon learned to set limits.

Throughout the war, the Civil Aeronautics Authority, the predecessor to the FAA, maintained a very good flight control system which contributed significantly to the safety of aircraft in the area. When the war was over the CAA discontinued providing that service west of Honolulu- The Army Airways Communication System attempted to provide that service but was unable to do so safely.

As a result, the Commander of the Naval Air Transport System, Pacific established his own system using purchased equipment and flight radiomen- He established Flight Control Centers at Kwajalein, Guam Saipan, and Manila. Flight Officers and flight radiomen were assigned to man these stations and to provide the necessary control of NATS flights in the area.
With the advent of the four new JRMs, VR-2 resumed the two day shuttle flight to Honolulu and soon established a multiple day flight to Manila. This flight went from Alameda via Honolulu, Majuro, Saipan to Manila. With flights to Manila in the offing, it was necessary to establish to establish an air to ground radio facility and a flight control facility at each station. Since a flight control facility already existed in Guam to control land plane transport operations, it was decided to let the JRM operations at Saipan be controlled there. It was necessary however, to establish an operational radio facility on Saipan. I was sent on temporary duty to Saipan to install and check out the necessary radio, establish high quality all weather communications between NAS Saipan and
NAS Agana Guam. The period of my temporary duty was three months.

While I was there, the CPO Club was small. The total personnel at the NAS Saipan was less then one hundred people. This was a far cry from the time during the War when the membership at the CPO club was in excess of 100. In those days, the Exchange System had not taken over the operation of the several clubs and as a result the CPO Club had operated as an independent facility. As a result the treasury of the club was in excess of $10,000.00. While I was there, the Exchange System published a notice that they would assume control of all such clubs in the near future. The assets of the club would become the property Of the exchange system. The way the membership of the club chose to reduce the net worth was to provide free beer.The club owned a ten cent slot machine. Seems whenever anyone came in for a free beer they would play the slot machine. As a result the free beer activity led to an increase in the net worth of the Club-
Finally, in desperation, the Club bought fourteen Snipe Sailboats for the Recreation Department.

With the establishment of a cognizant flight control system over the route, VR-2 then began regularly scheduled flights from Alameda to Manila. it took a crewman eight days to traverse the trip due to crew rest. Shortly after my return I was transferred to VR-8 inHonolulu. I was immediately sent to Kwajalein to supervise a similar flight control station. I was there a year. In the interim Milly and Cookie remained in Alameda, but had to move from Navy housing back to Federal Housing. So she again had to completely refurbish the new apartment to make it attractive and liveable.

Upon my return to Honolulu, I applied for and received Quarters in Navy Housing at Pearl Harbor, I then arranged for Milly and Cookie to join me there. They came by surface ship and when they arrived I got the assigned apartment. It took me several days to repaint the entire apartment.

When I was almost through, less than a month, I was ordered to go to NAS Jacksonville to supervise the installation of radar on the selected squadron aircraft. When I asked why, I was told that a part of the squadron would be transferred to Germany to participate in the Berlin Airlift. Of course I was among squadron personnel selected. So, I left Milly and Cookie in Honolulu and proceeded to NAS Jacksonville.

The Navy anticipated several severe crashes in the Air Lift operation and as a result, chose to transfer those dependents left in Honolulu. They were asked to move close to a loved one . Milly and Cookie went to Gassaway. Cookie was afraid because she was going to have to fly back to the Mainland. Milly assured her that they were safe, they were going back on the Mars. Of course all the crew on the flight knew me and they made Milly and Cookie welcome.

Our household effects were packaged and sent to Gassaway. Grandad stored them as a big package in the Gas Office. After the installation of the radar was was complete, I went to Frankfort, Germany to join the VR-8 Detachment there. We were assigned Parking spaces for our aircraft in company with the some twenty Troop Carrier Squadrons already there and in operation. Our sister Navy squadron, VR-6, was located at another base, Wiesbaden, AFB.

The ground support facilities provided were minimal consisting of two Quonset Huts, which were not closed on the ends. The first thing we did was to unpack the spare parts we had brought from Honolulu and use the crating material to enclose and partition the open Quonset huts. This provided us office space and the shop space we needed to support operations. The remainder of the packing material was used to provide a huge bon fire to keep the line personnel warm as they provided line service to the squadron aircraft.

The German AC Power was too unstable to be used to power the electronic test equipment so we used the auxiliary power units used to start aircraft for a power source. We used empty instrument cases modified to support a chimney as a heat source in our shop. We used coal dust we swept off from the aircraft cabin as fuel.

We were working a twenty-four shift initially to get the airplanes unloaded, the offices built and the squadron in operation when things began to be settled we were bussed to our temporary quarters which were former Storm Trooper Quarters in Frankfort. The bus ride from the Air Base was our quarters was over an hour each way. The quarters were minimal having only three showers for the entire squadron. Each floor , however, had a female maid to keep things clean. Food was prepared by the Army with German help.

Since I was sent on short notice, I only had summer uniforms. No topcoat, etc. I about froze the first couple of weeks. Fortunately. my sister, Sarah and her husband, Willard Hann, were stationed at Heidelberg with the Army and I spent a lot of available time with them.

When the interior of the airplane became too dusty with flour and coal dust they were taken to Manchester England to be washed. Manchester had the only interior wash rack capable Of washing R5D aircraft. This was normally a 36 hour period that the airplane was out of service.

Although aircraft were selected to be use on this operation were for the most part low time from Periodic Maintenance, one of the aircraft had enough operating time to require Periodic Maintenance. This meant that the aircraft would have to be returned to the US and substituted for a newly overhauled plane. It was decided to accomplish this over the Christmas Holidays. I was selected as one of three men to take the aircraft back
We departed from Rein-Main on December 22 for Paris to fuel for the trans-Atlantic flight. We gassed in Paris to conserve the fuel in Germany for the Air Lift operations. We remained overnight and left Paris early on December 23, destination Patuxent River.

About 125 miles west of the French Shoreline and 150 miles south of England the recirculating oil pump on the number 3 engine failed, dumping all 50 gallons of oil for that engine in the ocean. Of course we feathered the engine and held a council of war.
If we went back to Paris we would be there at least a month awaiting a new engine or oil pump. None of us had either the money or the clothes to remain in Paris for the required period. The other option was to continue on three engines and slip the bad engine past authorities in the Azores and Newfoundland. These were our two future stops if we elected to continue. We left the engine feathered until we were almost in sight of the tower at Lagens, Azores. We then pumped all our spare oil into that tank and let the engine "windmill" as we landed on the other three, We then fuelled and filled the spare oil tank and the oil tank on the defective engine.

When we powered up to depart we started all four engines but let the bad engine idle. We then took off with the remaining three. As soon as we were out of sight we shut down the bad engine and continued on to Newfoundland on three. Before we were in sight of the airport we duplicated the procedure we had successfully used in the Azores.
When we landed in Westover AFB in Boston we pulled the same procedure. By this time we had run 250, gallons of oil through that engine and a large portion of it was still on the wing. When we started our takeoff run at Westover, engine exhaust ignited that oil. The tower frantically called the pilot, "You are afire". The pilot calmly replied "We know it". Of course the slipstream quickly extinguished the fire and we continued down to Patuxent River and delivered the airplane.

And I got to spend Christmas with Cookie and Milly. It was a blessing in our turbulent life. And she went to Boston to see me off. We returned to Germany with a newly re-furbished airplane. And some warm clothes for me. As a result of the differing maintenance procedures used by MATS and the Troop Carrier Command the Navy squadrons quickly took the lead in number of flights per day and tonnage delivered to Berlin.

The Air Lift continued the remainder of the winter and it became obvious to the Russians that the Alfiies could and would provide sustenance to the beleaguered Berliners. Therefore in the early spring Russia lifted the ban on surface transportation and the Berlin Air Lift was over.

As the squadron returned to Hawaii, I requested and got a transfer to a carrier air group located at NAS Alameda. So Milly and Cookie returned to Alameda. Even though the Air Group was located in Alameda, It normally deployed on one of the Pacific Fleet carriers for active duty. I was assigned to Fighter Squadron 91 in the Air Group. This squadron was responsible for the safety of the carrier and flew cover over the ship in a combat situation. The squadron had just returned from a six month deployment and received new model airplanes.

The new aircraft were Grumman F9F Tiger Cats. They were sub-sonic and boasted four 20 mm fixed cannon, In combat the pilot maneuvered the airplane to bring the cannon to bear on the target in question. This required a great deal of skill in flying the airplane and a great deal of practice in weaponry.

The squadron received training on carrier operations by a series of short deployments aboard carriers at sea. Gunnery training was carried out at the Naval Facility in Fallon, Nevada The squadron spent several weeks there in target practice.

Upon completion of Squadron training we were sent aboard the USS Kearsarge for a six month deployment in the Orient. On this deployment I bought china ware in Tokyo for all of the family. I also bought Milly a strand of fine pearls in Japan. Upon my return I was transferred back to VR-2. The Navy had established an alternate landing facility for flying boats at Clear Lake, California.

The staff consisted of a Chief Radioman, an Aerograqpher and a Boatsmans Mate- We had a weather/communication trailer and a 26 foot crash boat. Space for the operation had been donated by one of the residents.

The purpose of the facility was to provide an alternate landing facility for the JRMs coming from Hawaii in the event weather prevented them from landing in Alameda. We provided the necessary landing facility but also took care of the passengers while they were waiting. This service was provided by the Chamber of Commerce in the town of Lakeport.

While we were stationed there, we rented an old house close to the facility, It was heated by am huge oil stove. When we had only been in the house a few days this stove blew up covering all our new painted walls with black soot. The renter provided some help and we got it cleaned up.

While we were there, Milly received word from her doctor in Alameda that a baby, soon to be born, was available for adoption. We jumped at the chance and went through the procedure which allowed us to adopt Barbara. We received her when she was eight days old and were thrilled to death. The adoption procedure. went without a hitch, unfortunately six months later I was transferred to Pensacola for shore Duty. The State of California had some reservation about us leaving

the state with Barbara but after some help with the Naval Authorities we were allowed to leave.

We made our first house purchase in Pensacola. The waiting list was long for Navy housing but there was significant building activity going on. Milly and I chose a small cinderblock house on Lillian Highway. It was newly built with three bedrooms on a large lot. The house had asphalt tile throughout . On a damp morning, until the slab dried out, you left footprints in the tile floor. We could not afford central air conditioning and made do with window fans and one small window air conditioner.

The back yard was edged in a rose hedge. We tried to get St. Augustine grass to grow by "sprigging" without much success. Our neighbor tried Centipede grass with some success. My brother Jim and his wife Verlene were also stationed there at the time. They had been there several months and Verlene sure helped Millv become acquainted with the Base.
Upon arrival in Pensacola, I was assigned to the staff of the Chief of Naval Air Training to work in the Communication Center. My task was to review each teletype message received and make sure it went to the appropriate Office. The communications staff which manned the teletype center was mixed gender a combination of white hats and waves. So as Leading Chief I also had my share of personnel situations to resolve. The Communications Officers were female recent college graduates with little or no professional experience in military or naval affairs which added to the burden
In the fall of 1956, Hurricane Debbie came ashore as a Class 3 Hurricane in Destin, Florida. Since Pensacola was within the area expecting high winds and rain, a Hurricane Alert was given and all personnel were to remain on duty- Horace brought his wife Verlene and their daughter Susan out to stay with Milly since their quarters on the base were not considered hurricane proof. My division Officer brought his wife and cat to stay with them.

The hurricane did not damage the little house. Milly said the most damage was the division Officer's cat and water blowing in under the front door.

After several months I requested a transfer to the Advanced Aviation Electronics School in Memphis, Tennessee. When I finished the first week of school, I had failed the course. The first several weeks were a review of mathematics as related to electronics, mainly Algebra. The course book was "Mathematics for Electricians and Radiomen " by
Cook. I went to the bookstore and bought a copy. And after work and as long as could stay awake I solved problems in Cook. I worked every problem in the book in two weeks. I never had problems with math after that.

Upon completion of the course I was assigned to Patrol Squadron 22 at NAS Barbers Point, Hawaii. At this point, I left Milly and the kids in Alameda and as soon as possible requested Instructor Duty in Memphis, Tennessee.

Upon reporting I completed the required Instructor training and was assigned as director of a portion of the Basic Electronics School. I served in that position for several months.

As soon as possible I enrolled at Memphis State University in evening classes in Mathematics and Physics. Ever since I had completed the Advanced
Electronics School, I had been attending College Level Courses at the University which was near my duty station. I had completed several courses at the University of California and at Memphis State University.

One evening while I was attending class at Memphis State, Milly went to a church function at Millington Baptist Church. On her way home with Barbara, standing upright in the passenger seat, Barbara somehow opened the door and fell out of the car. Milly was beside herself, rushed her to the Doctor but she was unhurt other than significant bruises and scrapes. You can be sure she never stood upright in that seat again.

The Naval Technical Training Command observed that newly commissioned officers from the enlisted ranks, although highly intelligent, did not in many cases have the forma) training necessary to allow them to perform their duties efficiently. it was decided to establish a course of study fifty two weeks in length to provide them with the basis for competition in the business world. The courses included Mathematics through Differential Equations, English through Technical Writing,
Speech, and Physics. Since i had completed Engineering Physics at Memphis State, I was selected to write and teach a course in undergraduate Engineering Physics.

The school was highly successful and our graduates compared favourably with graduates of four year engineering school. At this point had completed twenty years of active service.

At Milly's suggestion I enrolled in Louisiana State University for a degree in Electrical Engineering. Since the area rental properties were definitely subnormal, we purchased a small cottage using the Gl Bill to support our loan. In order to provide the necessary income to purchase a decent house I managed to get five places of employment on a part time basis.

The first one was in the Electrical Engineering Department at the University. They were updating the Department and had purchased all new training aids. These were obtained from Electronic Supply Houses and came in kit form- I was employed to assemble these kits and to troubleshoot them as required.

I then went to the Federal Communications Commission and took a test for a Radio Telephone Second Class- With this license, I was able to find a position as Night Broadcast Engineer at Radio Station WAIL. Since WAIL was the station of choice for broadcast of LSI-J Football. I was often field engineer for the games.

I became acquainted with the Professor of Nuclear Engineering at the University. He owned a company which was involved in nuclear testing Of industrial welding practices. His company purchased highly radioactive wafers from the Atomic Energy Facility at Oak Ridge and repackaged them to use in testing the quality of electric welding. I found a position as substitute teacher in the Evening Technical Training Classes provided by the Parish School Board.

I also was technical support in the Heart Station at the Baton Rouge General Hospital. My task there was to verity that the instruments used in Heart Catherization were operable and calibrated.

I completed the required course material and graduated from LSU in two years.
Upon graduation I was inducted into the National Engineering Honor Society Tau Beta Pi.

Also inducted into the National Electrical Engineering Society Eta Kappa NU.

Upon Graduation from LSU, I was interviewed by several organizations. Bell Telephone Laboratories asked me to visit their Laboratory at Whippany, New Jersey. I did visit and they offered me a position in Whippany developing the Telstar Satellite. I was simply overwhelmed. Telstar was the American answer to Russia's Sputnik.

When I refused, they suggested that I visit their North Carolina Laboratory. This laboratory was more in to military equipment design than straight telephony.

I then called on the laboratory in Winston Salem, North Carolina and met with a gentleman whose name was Earl Rutherford.

Earl was supervisor of a group, designing a missile tracking system to be used in conjunction with the appropriate missiles as an anti-Missile System. There were several loops being designed and he had one for me. It was the DR Tracking Loop which was to acquire the missile at mid-range exoatmospherically and track it until its re-entry into the atmosphere. He assured me that there was plenty of help and that I could depend on them to help me if I got stuck. He was so friendly and helpful that I had no problem joining with his group.

This might be a good to expound on the nature of the of the design activity at Bell Laboratories. Generally, a Laboratory was composed of several distinct groups. Each group was composed of several individuals each with a special talent in one or more areas. For example, there would be individuals who are specially talented in closed loop systems. Others would be especially talented in logical systems. Others would be talented in power regulation and control. But there would be an individual who is talented in system engineering. When a system is considered for design, each person would be given a project which coincided with his area of expertise. The system engineer would meld the several design elements into an operating system.

We then found a house on Capri Road in WinstonSalem that we could buy with nothing down and reasonable payments. We purchased the house even though it was not completely satisfactory. Cookie finished high school and we enrolled Barbara in cmall neighborhood.

Shortly thereafter, Cookie and a classmate from Reynolds High School, David Bell, were married. Cookie continued her education and achieved a MS as a Nurse anaesthetist. David continued his education and achieved a PhD in finance. He and Cookie lived in Massachusetts, Germany, and finally Bethesda Maryland. They were divorced after several years. They had two sons, David Michael and Jonathan. Cookie continued to live in Maryland and recently married John J. Gruel.

We then began to look for a house which was more to our liking. We found a wonderful house in the Town and Country subdivision which Milly liked very much and we purchased what was to be our home in Winston-Salem, the address was 1009 Tangle Lane and we were the first occupants. We then joined the College Park Baptist Church and soon made a circle ot friends. Milly began teachingToddlers and I had a Young Adult Class.

The loop that I was to design was the velocity tracking loop whose output was to be a digital signal Indicative of the velocity of the tracked Object. The loop was based on the pulled counter principle in which a given ultra stable voltage controlled oscillator's operating frequency was controlled by an error signal from the loop. The output was fed to the counter via a low impedance cathode follower. In the case of electronic countermeasures the loop was simply opened storing the last velocity measured-
chose to break the loop at the input of the cathode follower since this was a high impedance point. The input to the device was designed to remain at the last error signal observed. When the loop was opened for test, the input to the cathode follower did not remain constant but increased at a very small but linear rate. This would be indicative of the target accelerating. Since this was not possible in the test situation I adjusted the bias on the cathode follower until I got proper performance.

Even though the loop was performing as desired, t was intrigued by the phenomena I had observed.. I then began an exhaustive analysis of the electrical and physical characteristics of the vacuum tube.

As a result of this analysis I determined that in certain circumstances the work function of the control grid in a vacuum tube could be made to emit thus generating a small electrical current- I then wrote a Bell Laboratories Memorandum for File describing the characteristics. I then designed a circuit using those characteristics and patented it
Radiation Inc. was sub-contracted to design and produce a Perimeter Acquisition Radar simulator. he design provided did not exhibit the characteristics of the radar antenna. I was tasked to re-design the simulator to more accurately depict the motion of the antenna. In the simulator as delivered if the track crossed zero relative the simulator did a 360 degree rotation to pick up the new direction.

My design used a digital subtractor, subtracting the old position from the designated position. If the difference was less than one hundred eighty degrees, the antenna went clockwise from the present position to the new position. If the difference was greater than one hundred eighty
degrees the antenna went counterclockwise to.
the new position.
However I neglected to designate a direction for a one hundred eighty degree designation. It was completely ambient. The guys had a ball in Whippany using the simulator. They were making bets on which way the simulator would rotate given a reciprocal designation.
Our several subsequent design efforts were for weapon systems aboard Naval Cruisers. For the most part they involved upgrading present systems to improve accuracy and availability.
About this time Barbara finished grammer school and in view of the quality of education provided by the Integrated public schools at that level, we decided to enroll her into Salem Academy for her High School education. The classes were smaller and theïteachers were better qualified.
The next challenging effort came about when a
new radar was installed on the USS Canberra in a shipyard update. The radar was designed and built by the Gilfillan Radar. It was an extremely complex system and the interface to the installed Weapon Direction Equipment was accordingly complex. The radar system generated five lines of search video which could be melded together for Range and Bearing Data but must be displayed separately for Height Data. Since there was only one cathode ray gun available for height data, it was not possible to meld the data and display it on a single trace. Since the bearing and range were displayed elsewhere, a method had to be devised to display height data sequentially. Obviously the first height display could be in real time with the other in sequences behind it. Since the range and bearing were determined by the other display trace, we could take the section surrounding the target for display. We chose a six mile section about the target for our height display. This was about seventy five microseconds in the range data We could display the first segment in real time, delay the second segment seventy microseconds then display it on a newly generated trace. The third segment seventy five microseconds would be delayed one hundred fifty microseconds and also displayed on a newly generated trace- The fourth segment would be delayed two hundred twenty five microseconds and displayed on its own display trace, The final segment would be delayed three hundred microseconds and display the fifth trace. Of course electronic delay lines of this magnitude were unheard of..a delay of five microseconds was considered the best that could be developed. So a search was on for a display element which could simulate the radar return on the display and with the delay required to generate the display, It was finally developed using a audio level pulse and a glass delay line. To the observer it was a true simulation of the target observed.
We were then tasked to commence a study and design effort related to the detection of submarines. It was commonly known that any machine has a characteristic sound as unique to that machine as a fingerprint is to an individual. Most of the differences lie in the region below one cycle per second. In order to perform a quantitative analysis, each wave must be isolated and its characteristic examined in detail. This could only be performed at a multiple of the observed frequency since filters at the parent frequency are not amenable to filtering.
A common method of shifting the characteristics of a signal to another frequency is the method used in AM Radio called hetrodyning. This technique combines the desired signal with another known signal across a non=linear device. The output is the two original signals, their sum and difference and unlimited harmonics. Since the generation of harmonics makes it impossible to analyze the
shifted desired signal. This technique is not usable for this purpose.
A more desirable technique is illustrated by Alvin and the Chipmunks. in those recordings The tape is recorded at real time and reproduced at twice real time. This can be confirmed by playing back a recording of the Chipmunks at half speed. The voices are normal ,male voices. Since this was a completely linear operation no extraneous signals were introduced.'
Variations of this technique was used to shift the extremely low frequency signals desired for analysis to a frequency where detailed analysis could be performed. Using this technique the Navy was able to generate characteristic signatures of all of the Russian Submarine fleet. This band shifting
technique was also employed in airbourne signal processors.
The advent of powerful airbourne digital computers has led to an abandonment of this technique .
The Russian Submarine Fleet was detected using the Black Sea to move submarines in to the Mediterranean Sea.
Unfortunately, the airbourne anti-submarine aircraft could not detect them once they were in the sea. The Naval Air Development Center, Johnsville, Pa sent a test group to the NAS Sigonela to conduct tests to determine the reason. Members of Bell Laboratories also accompanied the test group as observers. The test group chartered a sail boat in Naples. Using the sail boat so that the boat did not introduce engine noises, a sonic transmitter was towed away from a cluster of fifty sonobouys. The output of the sonobouys was recorded and analyzed with regard to signal detected versus distance from the cluster. This test was conducted in three areas of the
Mediterranean. The end result was that there was simply too many diesel powered boats in the area to allow non-directional sonobouys to be used in that area.
So the directional sonobouys were standard for anti=submarine activities there.
When this test sequence was completed our group joined the entire department in the development of the Safeguard System. Our task was the design and development of The Ballistic Missile Defense Center to be installed in The NORAD Cheyenne Mountain Defense Center located deep within the Cheyenne Mountain near Colorado Springs. I was charged with the development of the several images to be exhibited on the Defense Center displays and to define the meaning of each display element I initially considered an analog type display as used by theflight control system of the FAA in control of the multitude of flights which they control almost continuously. Unfortunately, further study revealed that each flight control display only exhibited a tiny portion of the overall traffic in the air at any time.
Since the Ballistic Missile Defense Center was to be provided to allow manual control of the system to engage either an accidental launch or the first wave of a mass attack. I then defined a system using tabular displays with appropriate alerting mechanisms to accomplish this mission.
We then carried the BMDC hardware to Colorado
Springs and installed it in the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. Milly went with me and we had a nice little apartment in Colorado Springs. The one sad
event about the whole effort was that our little chihuahua pet was stolen. It was sad, we had had hum as a pet for 15 years.
I then wrote a five hundred page Man/Machine Interface document describing the several console positions and the technique for their employment. The Army immediately classified this document SECRET and based the training of the necessary staff on the contents.
When the installation and testing of the BMDC was complete we returned to our home location in North Carolina. Unfortunately with the completion of that portion of SAFEGUARD, several thousand engineers were without assignment and there were no Federal tasks to assign them to. We were told to investigate Bell System openings and to secure a place where our talents could be best used.
Many of our group went to Indian Hill near Chicago to participate in the development of the cellular telephone. Others found other places in the Bell System Network. I was given three suggested options. One of course was the Indian Hill Laboratory near Chicago where development was under way for the cellular telephone. A second was the Columbus Ohio Laboratory where development of crystal structure was involved. The third option was the Indianapolis Laboratory where the design and manufacture of residential telephones was under way.
After visiting Columbus and Indianapolis, I chose
Indianapolis. Milly and I moved the household to Indianapolis and purchased a house. Barbara, who had completed High School at Salem Academy, also moved with us. The house we initially purchased turned out to be not what Milly expected it to be. I re-painted the exterior but could not do anything about her problems with the interior.
We then purchased a corner lot in the Eagles Nest Subdivision and contracted with the person who is reputed to be the best builder in town. The lot as purchased had five beautiful oak trees on it. I asked the contractor to place the house so that these trees would be spared. He tried but killed one in the building process.
Since I chose not to actively supervise the construction process, the house he built was definitely sub-standard. We managed to correct most of the obvious faults.
The winter after we moved into the new house, Indianapolis had the worst storm in decades.
Barbara wanted to become a veterinarion At that time her love for animals led her toward a career in veterinary medicine. Since Purdue University had an outstanding Vet school, I enrolled her in Purdue in the fall semester. To finance her education, I simply allocated my retirement pay from the Navy to her. She used that to pay her tuition and to provide necessary expenses for housing. She also got a job as life guard.
Shortly into her second semester, she changed her major from veterinary medicine to nursing. About this time she met a young sailor attending Purdue on a Navy Scholarship. Kelly Lunn , who was from North Carolina, was a Second Class Petty Officer whose course of study was for atomic submarines.
They soon had a hot romance going.( He had a Triumph TR6 convertible.)
I was transferred in to a group in the Laboratory there which was engaged in the development of new technology for residential use. A first effort which was suggested was the development of a Maintenance Termination Unit. This element should indicate to the Central Office if a Fault on residential line was on the line or in the residence. This was important in that one of two crafts involved to repair a line fault. if the fault was
inside the house, the correction would be made by an Installer. If the fault was in the line, a Lineman would correct the fault. The installer and the Lineman were represented by two different unions.
Since the cost of dispatching a corrective person was on the order of one hundred dollars, it was important that the proper craft be sent. Since a Maintenance Termination Unit would be installed on every residential line, the cost of the unit must be very low. With these parameters in mind, a very low cost circuit was designed to accomplish the desired task. An application for a patent was issued.
Before the patent was granted, a much brighter person developed a cheaper solution. A telephone jack was mounted in the junction box where the line and the house wiring were interconnected. If a trouble was noted, the user simply brought one of the plug-in house phones out and connected to the Central Office From that jack unless the problem was a line problem in which noconnection was possible.
A representative of Texas Instruments, on a visit to the plant, introduced me to a newly developed, Instruments 4 bit programmable computer chip.
We used the device in several possible products. None of which were successful with the exception of a twenty number one button dialer. This device would dial any one of twenty pre-selected numbers . This device was successfully developed and merchandised as an adjunct to the residential Princess Telephone . It was later incorporated into the several new instruments introduced.
Since the technology in the Indianapolis Laboratory did not seem fit for me and the vicious winters in Indiana were not nice, I decided to look for a position further south. So I loaded a briefcase with resumes and visited the Plants at Shreveport and Atlanta. The Shreveport plant manufactured extension of telephones and was simply an extension of the effort in Indianapolis. The Atlanta plant was the wire manufacturing plant. Neither Laboratories locations had a place for me.
I then transferred to Western Electric Company and was hired at the Atlanta Plant. to do investigation on new wire related products. The first project was an evaluation of the carbon block Protector. This device was a pair of carbon electrodes placed across the telephone line to give fisrt order protection from lightning strikes on the line. As designed the blocks arc over at a potential greater than 1000volts. The telephone instrument is protected to 8000 volts. However each time the block shorts out a bolt, a portion of the carbon is burned increasing the breakdown voltage.
The performance of the block was compared to a gas tube and the performance of the gas tube was shown to be clearly better so that the carbon
blocks were replaced with gas tubes. In performing this test approximately 3000 iterations were performed.
While we were in Atlanta, Barbara decided not to marry Lunn and came to Atlanta . She had earned an Associate of Science in nursing and came to Atlanta to work at Grady Hospital, We got transferred back to Winston Salem and Barbara stayed in Atlanta..
We purchased another house in the Town & Country Subdivision. The house had three bedrooms and a full Basement. Part of the basement had been converted into another Family room. I moved my desk into that space and for the most part used it as a home office.
Barbara met an Inhalation Therapist named David Elmore. After a whirlwind courtship, they were married in a formal wedding in Winston Salem They continued to live and work in Atlanta and in
Short order they were parents of two children, David Conner and Christine Elise.
When Christine was born David deserted his little family and left them burdened in debt. At Milly's insistence Barbara divorced David and moved to Winston Salem. She found a position at the local hospital and worked hard to clear her indebtedness.
A former classmate from Purdue heard that she was free and began to come to Winston-Salem to Visit her. Eventually Barbara and David Diltz became engaged and married. He was a professor at UTA and Took her to Arlington to live. They eventually purchased property in Covington, Texas which became their home. The children did well.
David is now a builder in Seattle and Christine is a Traveling Nurse in Hawaii,
I was assigned to a design group a the new Guilford
Center in Greensburg. The contract was with the US Air Force and involved the development of a new type memory device. It was based on a new memory principle developed by Bell Labs called a Bubble Memory. The Air Force was planning a new strategy in which aircraft would be deployed over hostile territory at almost ground level at speeds nearing Mach l. The entire flight was preprogrammed and installed directly in the aircraft controller on the flight line. A satisfactory memory element had not been found to transport the flight data from the laboratory to the flight line without the possibility of error. Disk drives and magnetic tape had both been determined to be unsuitable. Apparentfy the bubble memory had proved insensitive to shock and was to be used for that purpose. Before the completion of the task, the group involved were moved from Greensboro to Burlington, probably for security reasons
Since lived in Winston-Salem, this would require me to make a sixty mile one way commute daily
I left the project and joined AT&T Federal Systems..
AT&T Federal Systems was in the process of preparing bids for a new Nationwide Flight Control System for the Federal Aviation Administration. I was charged with an analysis of a line item in the Request for Proposal This line item was a 250 station Microwave network which would be a nationwide net.A conference with the contracting officer at the FAA revealed that the major competitor was Collins Radio Corp.. They had done business with the FAA before and was the contractor of choice. Obviously, our task was to develop a bid that would beat that submitted by Collins Radio. I therefore spent a lot of effort collecting all of the information I could find on
Collins Radio. I used the Freedom of Information Act to collect all the information available on their previous interface with government agencies.
I then used that information on an item by item analysis of each item stated in the RFP. After some two years of effort I derived their possible bid. My best estimate of their probable bid was $225 million.
This was presented to our Vice President who would make the bid to the FAA. He asked how sure we were of this amount. My supervisor told him we were 90 percent sure. He then submitted a bid of $220 million. We won the contract. When the bids were made public, Collins Radio had bid $224.8 million Just lucky I guess. Shortly after this episode I reached the age of 65 and was asked to retire. I did retire and at the request of the Comptroller of that division and the Vice President of that division, organized a private company continuing the competition assessment activity.
At Milly,s request I retired from this company after two active years.
In 1984, Jean Lockard's youngest daughter, Connie died suddenly in Luray, Virginnia. Jean was overcome with grief and we began to spend a great deal of time with her by visiting Ormond Beach several time each year.
Finally, on an impulse, we sold out in WinstonSalem and moved to Ormond Beach. It was Thanksgiving Of 1989. After a widespread search, we purchased the house at 4 Sea Gull Terrace. It was one of three model homes for the subdivision, Seabridge South. When we bought it, the house had been abandoned for something approaching a year and was in pretty bad shape.
With the help of Bob, Jean, and John Lockard , we completely renovated the house. Stripped off the original paint to the bare walls, completely painted the outside, and inside. Completely relandscaped the lot and shrubbery, replaced the roof shingles.
The four of us, Bob, Jean, Milly and I had a lot of fun days shopping in Jacksonville, Orlando, and wherever. If there was a new shop anywhere in
Central Florida, we made a point to visit. .The girls would shop and Bob and I would look at fat women. He had a thing for fat women .
Milly and I became active in the Baptist Hospital
Auxiliary. She had done this before in WinstonSalem and enjoyed the activity. My scant information in computers was put to work in the office of the Auxiliary. Establishing a software management program for the volunteers, keeping track of the time worked for each volunteer
About the year 2000, Milly's health began to fail and she had to curtail her hospital activity.
We had both been active in the First Baptist Church Program, her with Toddlers and me with Young
Married Couples. Due to our advanced age and Milly's declining health, we dropped out of active participation in leadership roles.
Milly's health continued to worsen and on
November 5,2010, I lost the love of my life.
